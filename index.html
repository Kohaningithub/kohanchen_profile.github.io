                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p id="intro">Hi, I'm Kohan, a data analyst, policy researcher, and curious thinker with a passion for turning complex questions into actionable insights. I'm currently pursuing my Master of Public Policy at the University of Chicago, specializing in Data Analytics, Finance, and Policy, after earning my undergraduate degree in Economics from Columbia University.</p>
                <p>My work lives at the intersection of data, decision-making, and impact. I've built tools to forecast financial market dynamics, analyzed innovation trends in clean technology, and explored healthcare and education disparities across U.S. communities. Whether I'm writing machine learning models in Python, designing dashboards in R Shiny, or conducting regression analysis in Stata, my goal is always the same: to tell clear, honest stories with data that can move policy or markets.</p>
                <p>What drives me most is curiosity. I love peeling back the layers of how systems work — from hydrogen supply chains to public insurance coverage — and asking what the data isn't saying yet. I also care deeply about bridging the gap between quantitative analysis and human impact, and I'm excited by roles where I can apply both rigor and empathy to solve meaningful problems.</p>
